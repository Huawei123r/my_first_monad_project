# Monetization Strategies

This document outlines potential monetization strategies for the dApps and smart contracts in this project portfolio.

## DeFi Protocols

*   **Transaction Fees:** The `SimpleDEX` and `NFTMarketplace` contracts could be modified to include a small transaction fee on each swap or trade. This fee could be collected by the contract owner or distributed to token holders.
*   **Protocol-Owned Liquidity:** The `SimpleDEX` contract could be modified to include a mechanism for protocol-owned liquidity, where a portion of the trading fees are used to purchase and lock liquidity in the DEX. This would provide a sustainable source of revenue for the protocol.

## dApps

*   **Premium Features:** The `TodoList` dApp could be extended to include premium features, such as the ability to create private to-do lists or to attach files to tasks. These features could be offered as a subscription service.
*   **Advertising:** The `TodoList` dApp could include a small advertising banner to generate revenue.

## Tooling and Infrastructure

*   **SaaS:** The `auto_interact.js` script could be developed into a full-featured SaaS product for developers building on the Monad Testnet. This product could provide a suite of tools for interacting with smart contracts, managing deployments, and monitoring on-chain activity.
*   **Consulting:** The expertise gained from building this project portfolio could be offered as a consulting service to other projects building on the Monad Testnet.
