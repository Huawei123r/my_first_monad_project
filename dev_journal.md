**Journal Entry: Simple ERC-20 Token (Core Token Standard)**

* **Project Name:** Simple ERC-20 Token
* **Category:** Core Token Standard
* **Network:** Monad Testnet
* **Deployment Timestamp:** June 28, 2025, 10:30:00 AM UTC (Simulated)
* **Contract Addresses:** 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3 (Simulated Deployment Address)
* **Purpose:** To create a basic, fungible token compliant with the ERC-20 standard. This is a fundamental building block for many decentralized applications, representing everything from utility tokens to governance tokens.
* **Key Functions Demonstrated:**
    * `constructor`: Mints the initial supply to the deployer.
    * `transfer`: Allows token holders to send tokens to other addresses.
    * `approve` / `transferFrom`: Enables delegated token transfers.
* **Associated Components:**
    * **Frontend (HTML/JS):** N/A for this project.
    * **Off-chain Script (Python):** N/A for this project.
* **How it was made:** The contract was written in Solidity using the OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation. It was compiled and deployed using Hardhat and a JavaScript deployment script.
* **Creative Decisions:** I chose to mint the entire initial supply to the deployer's address for simplicity. This is a common pattern for tokens where the founding team or organization controls the initial distribution.

* **Contract Addresses:** 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3 (Simulated Deployment Address)
* **Purpose:** To demonstrate the most basic state change on a blockchain. The counter contract is a "hello world" of smart contracts, showing how to read and write data to the blockchain.
* **Key Functions Demonstrated:**
    * `increment`: Increases the public `count` variable by one.
    * `decrement`: Decreases the public `count` variable by one.
* **Associated Components:**
    * **Frontend (HTML/JS):** N/A for this project.
    * **Off-chain Script (Python):** N/A for this project.
* **How it was made:** The contract was written in Solidity. It was compiled and deployed using Hardhat and a JavaScript deployment script.
* **Creative Decisions:** The contract is intentionally minimal to focus on the core concept of state changes. There are no access controls or other features, making it easy to understand for beginners.

* **Contract Addresses:** 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3 (Simulated Deployment Address)
* **Purpose:** To create a simple, two-party escrow contract. This contract holds funds from a depositor and only allows the designated beneficiary to withdraw them. It's a foundational concept in building trustless systems.
* **Key Functions Demonstrated:**
    * `constructor`: Initializes the contract with the beneficiary's address and locks the deposited funds.
    * `release`: Allows the beneficiary to withdraw the funds.
* **Associated Components:**
    * **Frontend (HTML/JS):** N/A for this project.
    * **Off-chain Script (Python):** N/A for this project.
* **How it was made:** The contract was written in Solidity. It was compiled and deployed using Hardhat and a JavaScript deployment script.
* **Creative Decisions:** The contract is designed for a single, one-time use. It's not designed for multiple deposits or complex conditions, which keeps the code simple and easy to audit. The beneficiary is set at deployment and cannot be changed.

* **Contract Addresses:** 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3 (Simulated Deployment Address)
* **Purpose:** To demonstrate the `Ownable` access control pattern. This is a simple and widely used pattern that restricts certain functions to be called only by the contract's owner.
* **Key Functions Demonstrated:**
    * `onlyOwner` modifier: Restricts access to a function to the owner of the contract.
    * `transferOwnership`: Allows the current owner to transfer ownership to a new address.
* **Associated Components:**
    * **Frontend (HTML/JS):** N/A for this project.
    * **Off-chain Script (Python):** N/A for this project.
* **How it was made:** The contract was written in Solidity, inheriting from OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract. It was compiled and deployed using Hardhat and a JavaScript deployment script.
* **Creative Decisions:** The contract includes a simple `setMessage` function that can only be called by the owner, providing a clear example of how the `onlyOwner` modifier is used.

* **Key Functions Demonstrated:**
    * `create`: Adds a new to-do item to the list.
    * `toggleCompleted`: Toggles the completion status of a to-do item.
* **Associated Components:**
    * **Frontend (HTML/JS):** A simple web interface to create and view to-do items.
    * **Off-chain Script (Python):** N/A for this project.
* **How it was made:** The contract was written in Solidity. The frontend was built with HTML and JavaScript, using the Ethers.js library to interact with the smart contract. The project was compiled and deployed using Hardhat.
* **Creative Decisions:** The frontend is intentionally simple to focus on the core interaction with the smart contract. It uses a CDN for Ethers.js to avoid the need for a complex frontend build process. The contract address in the frontend is a placeholder that needs to be replaced with the actual deployed address.

    * `setWithdrawalAmount`: Allows the owner to change the amount of tokens dispensed.
* **Associated Components:**
    * **Frontend (HTML/JS):** N/A for this project.
    * **Off-chain Script (Python):** N/A for this project.
* **How it was made:** The contract was written in Solidity. It was deployed using a Hardhat script that also deployed a new `SimpleToken` to be used with the faucet.
* **Creative Decisions:** The faucet has a 24-hour cooldown period for each user to prevent abuse. The owner can adjust the withdrawal amount, providing flexibility. The contract can also receive Ether to be used for gas fees when dispensing tokens.

* **Contract Addresses:** 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3 (Simulated Deployment Address)
* **Purpose:** To create a multi-signature wallet that requires a minimum number of owners to approve a transaction before it can be executed. This is a common security pattern for managing funds, as it prevents a single point of failure.
* **Key Functions Demonstrated:**
    * `submitTransaction`: Allows an owner to submit a new transaction.
    * `confirmTransaction`: Allows an owner to confirm a transaction.
    * `executeTransaction`: Executes a transaction once it has been confirmed by the required number of owners.

* **Key Functions Demonstrated:**
    * `nonReentrant` modifier: Prevents a function from being called again while it is still executing.
* **Associated Components:**
    * **Frontend (HTML/JS):** N/A for this project.
    * **Off-chain Script (Python):** N/A for this project.
* **How it was made:** The contract was written in Solidity, inheriting from OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` contract. It was compiled and deployed using Hardhat and a JavaScript deployment script.
